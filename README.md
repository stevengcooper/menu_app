# Restaurant/Cafe Website
Every Restaurant/Cafe needs a place to display their wares online.  This application allows a user to add dishes to either Appetisers, Entrees, or Desserts.  These dishes will be stored in the database and be displayed below the course.

### How to Use the Website
  * To add a dish to a course:
    * Click on the link above the course picture.  It will lead you to a page to enter:
      1. Name
      2. Price
      3. Description
      4. Course
    * This dish will then be displayed on the root page under its course.
  * What's your best idea for a dish involving biscuits?  Add a dish to Biscuit & Brew's Menu!
  * Visit us at [our heroku url](http://peaceful-garden-32256.herokuapp.com)

### Upcoming improvements to the Design
  * It makes no sense to allow anyone who goes to the website to be able to add dishes to the menu.  
    * These were the guidelines of the assignment and this Developer likes to give the Client/Teacher what they desire.
    * The next version of the app will have an authenticated login for Administrators.
      * Admin will be allowed to update the menu, edit menu items, and delete menu items.
      * Those without Admin permissions will only be able to view the menu.
  * There is no Brew List!
    * The next version will have a Brew list included.
